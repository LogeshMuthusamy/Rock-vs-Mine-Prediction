# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either **Rock (R)** or **Mine (M)**.  
It is based on the Sonar dataset and implemented using Python and Scikit-Learn.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Sonar signals are used to detect underwater objects.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on 60 numerical features.

4.Run Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb

Sample Prediction

The model takes 60 sonar readings as input and predicts:

Rock

Mine

Example Output:

The object is a Mine
